## 🧪 Learning Logs

> ### 🗓️ SQL Concepts Learned:
> - `JULIANDAY()` – Used for date calculations.
> - `STRFTIME()` – Formats and extracts date parts like year, month, day.
> - `JOINs` – Inner, Left, Right joins using FK-PK relationships.
> - Aggregate functions – `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, etc.

> ### 🧠 CCNA Basics:
> - OSI Model, Modulation/Demodulation
> - What is a network, modem, and difference between analog vs digital
> - Layer-by-layer breakdown using analogies
